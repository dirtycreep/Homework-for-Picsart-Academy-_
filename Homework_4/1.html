<p>Garegin Njdeh was a prominent Armenian military commander who led an anti-Bolshevik uprising in the southeastern province of Syunik in 1921, proclaiming there the Republic of Mountainous Armenia (RMA) and spoiling the Bolsheviks' plans to surrender the region, part of historical Armenian lands, to neighboring Azerbaijan.

                 better known by his <i>nom de guerre</i></small> <big>Garegin Nzhdeh</big> <sup><small>[b]</small> </sup>
                 <small> (Armenian: Գարեգին Նժդեհ, 
                 1 January 1886 – 21 December 1955), was an Armenian 
                 statesman and military strategist. As a member of the
                  Armenian Revolutionary Federation, he was involved 
                  in the national liberation struggle and revolutionary 
                  activities during the First Balkan War and World War I 
                  and became one of the key political and military leaders 
                  of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Mountainous_Armenia" alt="Republic_of_Mountainous_Armenia">First Republic of Armenia</a> (1918–1921). He is 
                  widely admired as a charismatic national hero by 
                  Armenians.</small> <sup><small>[1][2]</small> </sup>

                  <small> In 1921, he was a key figure in the establishment of 
                the Republic of Mountainous Armenia, an anti-Bolshevik 
                state that became a key factor that led to the inclusion 
                of the province of Syunik into Soviet Armenia. <sup><small>[3][4]</small> </sup>
                During World War II, he assisted the Armenian Legion of 
                the Wehrmacht in war against USSR, hoping that if Germany 
                succeeded in conquering the USSR, they would grant Armenia 
                independence.</small>  <sup><small>[5][6]</small> </sup></p></td>
