                 better known by his <i>nom de guerre</i></small> <big>Garegin Nzhdeh</big> <sup><small>[b]</small> </sup>
                 <small> (Armenian: Գարեգին Նժդեհ, 
                 1 January 1886 – 21 December 1955), was an Armenian 
                 statesman and military strategist. As a member of the
                  Armenian Revolutionary Federation, he was involved 
                  in the national liberation struggle and revolutionary 
                  activities during the First Balkan War and World War I 
                  and became one of the key political and military leaders 
                  of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Mountainous_Armenia" alt="Republic_of_Mountainous_Armenia">First Republic of Armenia</a> (1918–1921). He is 
                  widely admired as a charismatic national hero by 
                  Armenians.</small> <sup><small>[1][2]</small> </sup>

                  <small> In 1921, he was a key figure in the establishment of 
                the Republic of Mountainous Armenia, an anti-Bolshevik 
                state that became a key factor that led to the inclusion 
                of the province of Syunik into Soviet Armenia. <sup><small>[3][4]</small> </sup>
                During World War II, he assisted the Armenian Legion of 
                the Wehrmacht in war against USSR, hoping that if Germany 
                succeeded in conquering the USSR, they would grant Armenia 
                independence.</small>  <sup><small>[5][6]</small> </sup></p></td>
