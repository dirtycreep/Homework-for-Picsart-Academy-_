        <p>Garegin Ter-Harutyunyan was born on 1 January 1886 in the village of Kznut, Nakhchivan. He was the youngest of four children born to a local village priest. He lost his father, Ter Yeghishe, early into his childhood. Nzhdeh attended a Russian school in Nakhchivan City and continued his education at a gymnasium in Tiflis.

            Shortly after, he moved to St. Petersburg to continue his education at a local university. After two years of studying at the Faculty of Law, he left St. Petersburg University and returned to the Caucasus in order to participate in the Armenian national movements against the Ottoman Empire. In 1906, Nzhdeh moved to Bulgaria, where he completed his education at the Dmitry Nikolov Military College of Sofia and in 1907 received a commission in the army with the rank of lieutenant.</p>

                 better known by his <i>nom de guerre</i></small> <big>Garegin Nzhdeh</big> <sup><small>[b]</small> </sup>
                 <small> (Armenian: Գարեգին Նժդեհ, 
                 1 January 1886 – 21 December 1955), was an Armenian 
                 statesman and military strategist. As a member of the
                  Armenian Revolutionary Federation, he was involved 
                  in the national liberation struggle and revolutionary 
                  activities during the First Balkan War and World War I 
                  and became one of the key political and military leaders 
                  of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Mountainous_Armenia" alt="Republic_of_Mountainous_Armenia">First Republic of Armenia</a> (1918–1921). He is 
                  widely admired as a charismatic national hero by 
                  Armenians.</small> <sup><small>[1][2]</small> </sup>

                  <small> In 1921, he was a key figure in the establishment of 
                the Republic of Mountainous Armenia, an anti-Bolshevik 
                state that became a key factor that led to the inclusion 
                of the province of Syunik into Soviet Armenia. <sup><small>[3][4]</small> </sup>
                During World War II, he assisted the Armenian Legion of 
                the Wehrmacht in war against USSR, hoping that if Germany 
                succeeded in conquering the USSR, they would grant Armenia 
                independence.</small>  <sup><small>[5][6]</small> </sup></p></td>
